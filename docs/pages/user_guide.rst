User Guide
==========

Welcome to the ``IAR-vsc`` user guide!

This guide will take you through all the features the ``IAR-vsc`` plugin provides to enhance your workflow with ``IAR`` using the power of Visual Studio Code.
If you just want to get going, take a look at the Quickstart below.

Quickstart
----------

* Configure the following items:

    * ``IAR: Select Workbench``
    * ``IAR: Select Compiler``
    * ``IAR: Select Project``
    * ``IAR: Select Configuration``

* Configure an ``IAR - build`` task using ``Tasks: Configure Task``
* Build your project

Installation
------------

``IAR-vsc`` can be installed simply through the extension marketplace from Visual Studio Code.

Requirements
____________
This extensions presumes that you installed the ``cpptools`` plugin by  *Microsoft*. Also a working ``IAR`` installation is needed.

Configuring
-----------

The extension will automatically detect Embedded Workbench installations on your systems, as well as IAR projects in your VS Code workspace.
You may select which workbench to use, which configuration to build, and other settings using buttons in the statusbar.

You can also call the commands behind those buttons, see the ``contribution`` tab in the extension section of VS Code.
There is also a view in the explorer tab for changing these settings. The explorer view and status bar view are functionally equivalent,
so if you want you can hide one of them by right clicking on it.

To configure your project, configure the following options:

* IAR workbench installation
* Compiler
* Project (ewp file)
* Configuration

Note that if your Embedded Workbench is installed in a non-standard location, the plugin might not autodetect it.
In that case you will need to set `iarvsc.iarInstallDirectories` in your `settings.json` file, see :ref:`settings-label`.

Building
--------

When you execute the VSCode command ``Tasks: Configure Task`` two items are added which are generated by this extension:

* ``iar: IAR Build - template using selected workbench, project and config``
* ``iar: IAR Rebuild - template using selected workbench, project and config``

When selecting one of the two, a default task is generated which uses the workbench, project and configuration selected using the UI. When you select a different configuration, project or workbench, this script will use the newly selected items.

C-STAT
------

You can run C-STAT on your project with the ``iar-cstat: Run C-STAT Analysis`` task,
and clear the warnings with ``iar-cstat: Clear C-STAT Diagnostics``. 
When running these tasks, VS Code might prompt you about scanning the task output, and it is recommended to select ``Never scan the task output for iar-cstat tasks``,
since these tasks do not use a regular problem matcher.
C-STAT will run the checks selected in your project settings in Embedded Workbench, but you can filter the messages in VS Code
by setting ``iarvsc.cstatFilterLevel`` in your user settings.

Debugging
---------

In v1.1.0 settings are added to configure a gdbserver and a gdb executable. The following data for
the `launch.json` file will use this configuration to start debugging. Currently this is only for
testing and is work in progress. The settings are nog yet automatically updated when selecting
different projects or confiugrations (even though the description of the settings mention this).

Open or create the ``launch.json`` file and place your cursor at the beginning of the configurations
array. Now press ``Ctrl + Space`` to activate autocompletion. You should see an item like
``IAR: Debug using gdb server``. If you select this, the configuration below is automatically
generated.

Some information about the used config parameters:

* ``iarvsc.debugger``: The path to the debugger to use. In case your debugger is on your ``PATH``
  environment you can just enter the debugger executable like ``arm-none-eabi-gdb.exe``, otherwise,
  use the absolute path to the debugger.
* ``iarvsc.gdbServer``: The path to the gdb server. If you are using a J-Link Segger, you will
  probably have to enter the full path like: ``C:\GNU Tools ARM Embedded\2018-q4-major\bin\arm-none-eabi-gdb.exe``.
  Keep in mind you have to escape the *backslashes* ``\`` in *json*.
* ``iarvsc.device``: The device you are want to *flash* and *debug*. Check your *debug server*
  documentation which values you can use here.
* ``iarvsc.outFile``: This field is not yet used in the current release, but it is mentioned here for
  completeness. You can use it, but keep in  mind the value you enter here can conflict in future
  releases.

Extension Settings
------------------

This extension contributes the following settings:

* ``iarvsc.iarInstallDirectories``: The rootfolder where all IAR workbenches are installed. By default this is ``C:\Program Files (x86)\Iar Systems``. The default settings contain also the non-x86 folder in case IAR will move to 64-bit installations. Example for a custom install location:

.. code-block:: json

    "iarvsc.iarInstallDirectories": ["C:\\Custom\\Install\\Path"],
Note that you may need to reload VSCode after changing this.

* ``iarvsc.defines``: Some custom defines you can add to the define list. They follow the ``identifier=value`` structure. This list will contain all intrinsic compiler functions that are known by the author of this extension. If some are missing, create a GitHub issue.
* ``iarvsc.cstatFilterLevel``: Sets the lowest severity of C-STAT warnings to display.
* ``iarvsc.cstatDisplayLowSeverityWarningsAsHints``: When the filter level is set to low, this option will display low severity warnings as 'hints' instead of warnings. This is helpful if you have lots of low severity warnings and want to hide them from the problems list (but still see them in the editor).

Advanced usage
______________

Using the settings it is possible to automate other IAR tasks. You can for instance automate flashing the device or running tests in the simulator using the generated cspy scripts. These scripts are available in the ``settings`` folder present in the same folder as you ``.ewp`` file.
