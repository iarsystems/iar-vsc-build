# IAR-VSC-thrift

This is a modified version of `iar-vsc`, providing some thrift project integration.
Note that is **not** the actual development repo for this project, I just put this here to make it easier for others to find it.
The actual repo is on my (private) github for now.

## Building

See `Extension/README.md`.
