# IAR Build

Build and develop your IAR Embedded Workbench projects from Visual Studio Code.

* Build projects
* Manage project files
* Generate C-STAT messages and reports
* Use language features powered by the [C/C++ extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools)

An IAR Embedded Workbench or IAR Build Tools installation is required to use this extension. See [Compatibility](#compatibility) table below for detailed information.

> 💡️ To debug your Embedded Workbench projects from VS Code, please also see the [IAR C-SPY Debug extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=iarsystems.iar-debug).

## Getting started

To get started, open a folder containing an IAR Embedded Workbench project.
A view with an IAR Embedded Workbench icon will appear in the left side panel:

![side bar view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IARSystems/iar-vsc-build/master/images/readme/sidebar.png)

Here you may select the desired IAR Embedded Workbench/Build Tools installation,
and the project and project configuration you want to work with. If your IAR Embedded Workbench or IAR Build Tools installation
is not found automatically, please see [Adding IAR Embedded Workbench/Build Tools installations](https://github.com/IARSystems/iar-vsc-build/blob/master/docs/README.md).

To build or analyze the selected project configuration, go to `Terminal->Run Task...` and then select either the `iar` or `iar-cstat` category.
To make this easier, you may wish to [Add a default build task](https://github.com/IARSystems/iar-vsc-build/blob/master/docs/README.md#setting-a-default-iar-build-task).
